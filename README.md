### ABOUT US
#### We are the 'Kuttans Te Kudiyan'
'Kuttans Te Kudiyan' is derived from two languages, in which 'Kuttan' is taken from Malayalam meaning 'boy' and 'Kudiyan' is taken from Punjabi meaning 'girls'. Five Kuttans from Kerela and two Kudiyan from North India, together formed this group. We are M.Sc. BDA students from St. Joseph's College(Autonomous), Bangalore. The initial thought in mind was to prepare an easily accessible user-interface on 'Commonwealth Games Analysis'. Our motive while working on this project was to build a model to predict the medal tally for 2022 CWG which will be useful for sports betting companies to set the odds in advance, while sponsors and media companies can direct their resources to promising teams. We are trying to publish a research paper based on the findings we made through this project. We would really like to know your views on this.
